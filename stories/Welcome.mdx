# Welcome to Vantage Design System

Welcome to **Vantage Design System**, brought to you by Angel Solutions! This comprehensive guide is your go-to resource for working across all our products. Whether you're designing interfaces, implementing features, or ensuring consistency, Vantage is here to support you every step of the way.

## What is Vantage?

Vantage provides a unified set of UI components and design patterns that ensure a consistent and delightful user experience across our entire suite of products. Each component in our system is meticulously crafted to be reusable, accessible, and responsive.

## Using Storybook

To explore and utilise our components effectively, we use Storybook. Storybook allows you to interact with each component in isolation, view its variations, and understand its intended usage. Here's how you can navigate through our Storybook:

- **Component Catalogue**: Browse through our extensive catalogue of components categorised by type and functionality.
- **Interactive Demos**: Experiment with different props and states to see how components behave in various scenarios.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation accompanies each component, providing guidelines on usage, props, and examples.

## Getting Started

Begin your journey with Vantage by familiarising yourself with our foundational components and design principles. Whether you're a designer, developer, or product manager, Vantage empowers you to create cohesive and intuitive user experiences seamlessly.

We're excited to embark on this design journey with you. Let's build amazing products together with Vantage!
